In some cases, an embedding model is used for RAG, or a secondary model like GPT-4o for image processing.Note:For non-OpenAI reasoning models, the reasoning token budget is set at 1,024 (low), 2,048 (medium), and 4,096 (high).",VerifiedVerified ResultsResults have been reproduced by the HAL team,AccuracyAccuracyConfidence intervals show the min-max values across runs for those agents where multiple runs are available,"Cost (USD)Total CostTotal API cost for running the agent on all tasks.
